# smallpt-ultibo (single threaded version)

Ultibo bare-metal Raspberry Pi Pascal port of smallpt... annd breathe!

A long long time ago I ported the smallpt renderer to Turbo Pascal 1.  
* [smallpt](http://www.kevinbeason.com/smallpt/)  
* [my port story](http://iwasdeportedandalligotwasthislousydomain.co.uk/static.php?page=smallpt_tp)

This is simply recompiling that port to target the Raspberry Pi using the [Ultibo](https://ultibo.org) toolchain.  

*Caution:* you may want to use a heatsink when running this, as I think it'll just burn through the CPU quite happily.
